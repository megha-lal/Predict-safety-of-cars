# Predict-safety-of-cars

This is my first attempt at decison tree algorithm. 

The dataset contains various attributes related to various brands of cars. The safety levels are labelled as low, medium and high. The dastet is not numerical. So I have used encoding to convert string data into numerical data.

The obtained accuracy score is 0.85
